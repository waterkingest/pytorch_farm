# Water body extraction algorithm
1. `nets` holds the network structure
2. `utils` for data preprocessor
3. `VOCdevkit` for training and validation data.
4. run `train.py` for training
5. test extraction with `predict.py`
6. `movepredict` for sliding window extraction.
7. `logs` to store the trained weights.
8. `tool` stores data processing gadgets
